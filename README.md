# Clothing E-commerce app
A simple e-commerce app, created using React and firebase, and deployed on Netlify - https://friendly-longma-a6180c.netlify.app/

## Features
1. Home page - shows a list of categories, each of which route to a category-specific page with a list of products.
2. Shop page - shows the same list of categories, along with a preview of products.
3. Checkout page - shows a list of all items added to the cart.
4. Sign-in page - A (work-in-progress) simple signin/signup component, which currently doesn't redirect anywhere. :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ToDo
1. Basic payment functionality
2. Mobile Responsiveness and basic optimisations
